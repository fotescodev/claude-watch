  # ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  # NEW (correct):  Watch shows code → User types code into `npx cc-watch` CLI
  # OLD (obsolete): CLI shows code → User types code into watch app
  #
  # The watch INITIATES pairing and DISPLAYS the code.
  # The CLI COMPLETES pairing by RECEIVING the code.

      Build the watch app and install on physical Apple Watch.

      Prerequisites:
      1. Physical Apple Watch paired with your iPhone
      2. Apple Developer account
      3. Provisioning profile for physical device

      Steps:
      1. Open Xcode: `open ClaudeWatch.xcodeproj`
      2. Select your physical watch as destination
      3. Sign with your development team
      4. Build and run (Cmd+R)

      If signing issues:
      - Go to Signing & Capabilities
      - Select your Team
      - Let Xcode manage signing

      The app should appear on your watch's home screen.

      Complete pairing between Mac and physical Apple Watch.

      NEW FLOW (watch shows code, CLI reads it):
      1. On physical watch:
         - Open Claude Watch app
         - Tap "Pair Now"
         - Watch displays a 6-digit code

      2. On Mac CLI:
         ```bash
         npx cc-watch
         ```
         - Enter the code FROM the watch INTO the CLI
         - Pairing completes automatically

      3. Verify pairing saved:
         ```bash
         cat ~/.claude-watch/config.json
         ```
         Should contain pairingId

      The hook reads from ~/.claude-watch-pairing, so sync it:
      ```bash
      jq -r .pairingId ~/.claude-watch/config.json > ~/.claude-watch-pairing
      ```

    description: |
      Enable the hook that routes Claude Code permission prompts to the watch.

      The hook is in .claude/settings.json but currently disabled (PreToolUse: []).

      To enable:
      ```bash
      ./.claude/hooks/toggle-watch-hooks.sh
      ```

      Or manually edit .claude/settings.json:
      ```json
      "PreToolUse": [
        {
          "matcher": "Bash|Write|Edit|MultiEdit",

            }
          ]
        }
      ]
      ```

      Note: In dev mode, you may want hooks disabled. Toggle as needed.

    title: "Test end-to-end approval flow (THE DOG WALK TEST)"
    description: |
      THE FINAL TEST: Walk your dog while approving Claude Code requests.

      SIMULATOR TEST: ✅ PASSED (2026-01-18)
      - Notification received correctly
      - Main view updates live when request arrives
      - Approve/Reject buttons functional
      - MainActor fix deployed

      E2E TEST: ✅ PASSED (2026-01-18)
      - Hook blocks Claude Code until watch approval
      - Push notification arrives when app backgrounded
      - Approve from watch → Claude Code proceeds
      - Full remote control flow verified

      Setup:
      1. Physical watch paired and app running
      2. APNs configured and working (DONE)
      3. PreToolUse hook enabled
      4. Claude Code running on Mac

      Test Steps:
      1. Start Claude Code session on Mac
      2. Ask Claude to make a file change (e.g., "add a comment to MainView.swift")
      3. Physical watch should:
         - Receive push notification (may take 1-2 seconds)
         - Show request details
         - Provide Approve/Reject buttons
      4. Tap Approve on watch
      5. Claude Code should continue and make the change
      6. Test rejection: Ask for another change, tap Reject
      7. Claude Code should stop and report rejection

      Go for a walk:
      - Leave Mac running Claude Code
      - Walk away with watch
      - Approve/reject from anywhere with internet

  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # BUG FIXES - READY FOR VERIFICATION
  # Simulator: Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm) - SHOULD BE RUNNING
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  - id: "BF1"
    title: "Verify notification fixes: live update + cleanup"
    description: |
      TWO FIXES IMPLEMENTED - NEED VERIFICATION:

      FIX 1: Live UI update from push notifications
      - Problem: Notification arrived but MainView showed "All Clear"
      - Solution: Added `addPendingActionFromNotification()` in ClaudeWatchApp.swift
      - Called in `willPresent` when notification arrives
      - Also called when user taps notification to open app

      FIX 2: Clear notifications after approve/reject
      - Problem: Old notifications stayed in notification center
      - Solution: Added `clearDeliveredNotification(for:)` in WatchService.swift
      - Called after respondToCloudRequest, approveAction, rejectAction
      - approveAll clears ALL delivered notifications

      VERIFICATION STEPS (run these commands):
      ```bash
      # 1. Build and install (simulator should be running)
      xcodebuild -project ClaudeWatch.xcodeproj -scheme ClaudeWatch \
        -destination 'platform=watchOS Simulator,name=Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm)' build

      # 2. Install app
      xcrun simctl install "Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm)" \
        ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/ClaudeWatch-*/Build/Products/Debug-watchsimulator/ClaudeWatch.app

      # 3. Launch app
      xcrun simctl launch "Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm)" com.edgeoftrust.claudewatch

      # 4. Send test notification
      cat > /tmp/test.json << 'EOF'
      {
        "aps": {"alert": {"title": "Test", "body": "Verify fix"}, "sound": "default", "category": "CLAUDE_ACTION"},
        "requestId": "verify-001", "type": "bash", "title": "Test Action", "description": "Verify notification fix"
      }
      EOF
      xcrun simctl push "Apple Watch Series 11 (46mm)" com.edgeoftrust.claudewatch /tmp/test.json

      # 5. VERIFY: MainView should show "Test Action" with approve/reject buttons
      # 6. Approve the action
      # 7. VERIFY: Notification should disappear from notification center
      # 8. VERIFY: MainView should return to "All Clear"
      ```

      If all verifications pass, mark this task complete and commit.

    title: "Fix progress card to reflect actual state"
    description: |
      BUG: Progress card shows "Ready for tasks 0%" even when:
      - There are pending actions waiting for approval
      - Status is .waiting

      EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
      - When pendingActions.count > 0: Show "1 action pending" (or count)
      - When status is .waiting: Don't show "Ready for tasks"
      - Progress bar should reflect pending vs completed actions

      IMPLEMENTATION:
      1. Find the progress card view in MainView.swift or similar
      2. Update to read from WatchService.shared.state.pendingActions
      3. Show appropriate text based on state:
         - .idle + no pending → "Ready for tasks"
         - .waiting + pending → "N action(s) pending"
         - .running → "Working..."
      4. Progress bar: pendingActions.isEmpty ? 100% : based on queue

      FILES TO CHECK:
      - ClaudeWatch/Views/MainView.swift
      - Look for "Ready for tasks" string
      - Look for progress bar / percentage display

      VERIFICATION:
      1. Send test notification
      2. Progress card should update to show pending action
      3. After approve, should return to "Ready for tasks"

      DEFERRED: After BF2 is complete, consider deeper integration.

      The progress indicator could track actual Claude Code session activity:
      - Track when a session starts/ends
      - Show task count and progress from Claude's TodoWrite
      - Update progress bar based on completed vs pending tasks
      - Show "Working on: [task name]" when actively processing
