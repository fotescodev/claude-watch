## Handoff Notes

*Write any context the next session needs to know:*

### Phase 10 Research Complete (2026-01-22) ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Problem**: We tried to implement answering Claude's AskUserQuestion from the watch but our approach was fundamentally flawed.

**What We Tried (Failed)**:
1. PreToolUse hook intercepts AskUserQuestion
2. Hook sends question to cloud, waits for watch answer
3. Hook writes answer to a file
4. StdinProxy tries to inject answer into Claude's terminal stdin
5. ❌ FAILS - timing issues, terminal UI already rendered, can't inject reliably

**What Happy Coder Does (Works)**:
1. Uses `--output-format stream-json --input-format stream-json` (CLI flags, NOT direct API)
2. Uses `--permission-prompt-tool stdio`
3. Claude sends `control_request` JSON via stdout when needing permission/answers
4. CLI responds with `control_response` JSON via stdin
5. ✅ WORKS - clean JSON protocol, no terminal UI to fight
6. ✅ NO API COSTS - still uses Claude CLI, just with JSON output mode

**Key Insight**: You can't inject answers into Claude's interactive terminal UI. You need to use SDK/streaming mode where Claude sends JSON requests and receives JSON responses.

**Next Steps for Phase 10**:
1. Read `.claude/plans/phase10-RESEARCH.md` for full analysis
2. Pivot to SDK approach: `--output-format stream-json`
3. Implement `control_request`/`control_response` handling
4. Study Happy Coder's `cli/src/claude/sdk/query.ts` for implementation

**Reference Code**: `/tmp/happy-research/happy-main/cli/src/claude/` (extracted from happy-main.zip)

### Phase 8 V2 Redesign Planned (2026-01-21)
- Full V2 specification analyzed from `/v2/` directory
- Created `phase8-CONTEXT.md` with complete implementation plan
- **7 new flows:** F15-F21 (questions, todos, sub-agents, resume, context, undo, background)
- **11 new event types** to implement in WatchService
- **Anthropic brand refresh:** Official colors + SF Symbols (no emojis)
- **3 new quick commands:** Resume, Compact, Undo
- Implementation order: Events → Questions (P0) → Resume (P0) → Context/Undo (P1) → Todos/SubAgents (P2) → Brand refresh
- V2 is POST-LAUNCH work (~6 weeks after App Store submission)

### E2E Encryption Complete (2026-01-21)
- **COMP3A**: CLI encryption module using TweetNaCl (x25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305)
- **COMP3B**: Worker key exchange - stores/forwards public keys during pairing
- **COMP3C**: Watch decryption using CryptoKit (Curve25519 + ChaChaPoly)
- Keys exchanged during pairing flow:
  - Watch sends `publicKey` in `/pair/initiate`
  - CLI sends `publicKey` in `/pair/complete`
  - Watch receives `cliPublicKey` from `/pair/status`
- Both Debug (simulator) and Release (device) builds successful

### Phase 5 Implementation Complete (2026-01-21)
- ✅ Release entitlements with `aps-environment: production`
- ✅ PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy manifest
- ✅ COMP1 - SessionStart hook
- ✅ COMP3 - Full E2E encryption stack
- ✅ Archive/Release build tested
- 🔲 Privacy policy needs to be created and deployed
- 🔲 TestFlight submission pending

### Phase 5 Planning Complete (2026-01-21)
- E2E test passed - watch approval flow fully functional
- Created `.claude/plans/phase5-CONTEXT.md` with all decisions
- Key decisions: Separate entitlements, internal beta (5-10), GitHub Pages privacy policy
- Decided to include COMP1 + COMP3 before TestFlight (not COMP2/COMP4)
- Implementation order: Entitlements → Privacy manifest → COMP1 → COMP3 → Archive test

### Competitive Analysis Complete (2026-01-20)
- Analyzed Happy Coder (competitor): https://github.com/slopus/happy
- Cloned reference repos to `happy-*-reference/` (git-ignored)
- Created comparison: `.claude/analysis/happy-vs-claude-watch-comparison.md`
- Added 4 Ralph tasks: COMP1-COMP4 in `tasks.yaml`
- Created implementation spec: `.claude/plans/competitive-parity-implementation.md`
- Created context file: `.claude/plans/competitive-parity-CONTEXT.md`

### What Happy Does Better (learn from)
- E2E encryption (zero-knowledge server) - COMP3
- SessionStart hook (reliable session tracking) - COMP1
- Activity batching (2s flush) - COMP4
- Thinking state indicator - COMP2 (deferred)

### Ready to Implement
Run tasks in order: COMP4 → COMP1 → COMP3
- COMP4 is watch-side only, quick win
- COMP1 is foundation for session features
- COMP3 is multi-phase, highest value

### Previous Context
- Project is mature (~90% complete), focus on shipping not features
- All core features working, physical device tested
- Main gap is App Store submission requirements
- Use `/progress` to check current state
